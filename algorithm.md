1. Import the necessary modules (math and random).
2. Define the maze template as a 2D list.
3. Prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the start position and the goal position.
4. Convert the user input into integers and store them in variables (x, y for start and a, b for the goal).
5. Define the look_2 function to find possible moves from a given position (pos). This function should check the adjacent cells in the maze and return a list of valid moves.
6. Define the look function to find possible moves from a given position (pos). This function should check the adjacent cells in the maze and return a list of valid moves.
7. Define the backtrack function to backtrack to the previous position in case there are no valid moves from the current position.
8. Define the distance function to calculate the Euclidean distance between possible moves and the goal position. This function should return a dictionary with the distances as keys and the corresponding moves as values.
9. Define the move function to select the move with the minimum distance from the move_distances dictionary.
10. Define the make_path function to generate the path from the start position to the goal position. This function should use the look and look_2 functions, the distance function, and the move function to determine the next move in the path until the goal is reached.
11. Call the make_path function to generate the path.
12. Define the randomize_maze function to randomly assign values (0 or 1) to the interior cells of the maze. Iterate through the maze and replace each 2 value with a random value from the elements list.
13. Call the randomize_maze function to randomize the maze interior.
14. Set the goal position in the maze by assigning the '$' character to the corresponding cell.
15. Set the current position to the start position.
16. Define the print_maze function to print the maze.
17. Use a loop to iterate until the current position reaches the goal position:
18. a. Mark the current position with a '*' character in the maze.
19. b. Print the maze using the print_maze function.
20. c. Update the current position by selecting the next move based on the result of the look function and the distance and move functions.
21. The loop will terminate when the current position reaches the goal position.
